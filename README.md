Solution codes for drivendata.org machine learning competitions listed below

1. Deng AI.ipynb - Solution code for Deng AI: Predicting Disease Spread  
#### Problem Statement  
This problem requires us to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables 
describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.

2. Pump it up.ipynb - Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table
#### Problem Statement
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we will have to  predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs,
and which don't work at all?  We will have to predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump 
is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. 
A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available 
to communities across Tanzania.

3. Predict Blood donations.ipynb - Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations
#### Problem Statement
The problem requires us to predict the donation based on the features that are available in our dataset

#### Motivation
Here the primary reason for doing these competitions are to test our machine learning skills. 
We will try to climb the leaderboards in the competitions rather we will just use them for practice

#### Dependencies
1. Python 3+
2. Sklearn
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Xgboost
6. Matplotlib
